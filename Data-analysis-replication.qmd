1.  DEFINITION OF COMMON TERMINOLOGIES USED ACROSS AN ARTICLE: GLOSSARY (FOR READERS UNDERSTANDING OF SUBSEQUENT CONTENT KEPT AT THE BEGINING)

    ***i ) Standard Frequency (SF)***: Refers to frequencies ranging from 250Hz to 8kHz.

    ***ii) Extended High Frequency (EHF):*** Refers to frequencies ranging from 9kHz to 16kHz. In this article, the author calculated the average thresholds at 10kHz, 12.5kHz, and 16kHz to determine EHF threshold. If the threshold exceeds 20dB at any frequency and in either ear, it is considered as EHF loss.

    ***iii) Otitis Media (OM):*** Refers to a medical condition caused by recurrent ear infections.

    ***iv) Distortion Product Otoacoustic Emission (DPOAE):*** A test used to assess the functionality of outer hair cells, which are part of the inner ear structure in humans.

    ***v) PTA*** : Pure tone average

    *vi) PTASF :* Pure tone average of standard frequencies (average threshold of frequencies 500Hz, 1kHz, 2kHz and 4kHz)

    ***vii) PTAEHF**:* Pure tone average of extended high frequencies (10kHz, 12.5kHz and 16kHz)

2.  INTRODUCTION OF AN ARTICLE

    A\) BACKGROUND

    Regardless of degree and type, pediatric hearing impairment has a detrimental effect on speech perception, cognition, oral language development, academic outcomes, and literacy. Hearing assessment in the clinic is limited to 8 kHz, although humans can hear up to 20 kHz. Hearing impairment in the extended high frequencies (EHFs \> 8 kHz) can occur despite clinically normal hearing. However, the nature and effects of EHF hearing impairment in children remain unknown. This study aimed to determine the effects of EHF hearing impairment on speech-in-noise recognition in children and to examine whether hearing impairment in the EHFs is associated with altered cochlear functioning in the standard frequencies.

    **B )Methods (In brief)**

    542 participants (4 to 19 years) with clinically normal audiograms were taken via convenient sampling method. Participants identified with EHF impairment were assigned as cases in a subsequent case-control study. EHF loss was defined as hearing thresholds greater than 20 dB in at least one EHFs (10, 12.5, or 16 kHz). Speech recognition thresholds in multi-talker babble were measured using the digit triplet test. Distortion product otoacoustic emissions (f2 = 2, 3, 4, and 5 kHz) were measured to assess cochlear functioning*.*

**C) Main results and conclusion of an article (in brief)**

-   The study identified thirty-eight children who demonstrated EHF hearing impairment despite presenting clinically normal audiograms. Through a linear mixed-effects model analysis, it was observed that children with EHF hearing impairment exhibited a lower mean DPOAE magnitude compared to those with normal EHF sensitivity. The overall DPOAE magnitude was significantly diminished in the EHF-impaired group relative to the EHF-normal group, with no significant effects of age or history of otitis media (OM) observed. Furthermore, children with EHF impairment displayed relatively higher pure-tone averages for standard audiometric frequencies, indicating potential preclinical cochlear deficits in lower frequencies where hearing thresholds remained normal. These results highlight the prevalence of EHF impairments in children and stress the importance of clinically identifying such impairments, even in the absence of a history of otitis media, to address potential difficulties in speech-in-noise recognition and associated cochlear deficits.

3.  DATA ANALYSIS REPLICATION OBJECTIVES:

    In this data replication assignment, My objectives are to replicate the following analyses in order to highlight the major findings of the study:

    -   Overall speech recognition threshold according to age group (Descriptive statistics)

    -   The extended high frequency threshold for the EHF-normal and EHF-impaired groups (Descriptive statistics).

    -   Visualization of hearing threshold across frequencies (250Hz-16kHz) for both the EHF-normal and EHF-impaired populations to illustrate the main findings of the study.

    -   Visualization of DPOAE magnitude for both the EHF-normal and EHF-impaired groups across frequencies.

    -   Replication of inferential statistics to demonstrate differences in threshold between the groups for both standard frequency and extended high frequency.

    -   Replication of inferential statistics to confirm differences in DPOAE magnitude while controlling for the effects of age and otitis media infection.

4.  **Read the original dataset provided by the authors**

```{r, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
f <- "Data/NHC_DataAna_Sajana.csv"  
d <- read.csv(f, header = TRUE, sep = ",")
head(d)
ncol(d)
nrow(d)
```

5.  **REPLICATION OF DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS**
````

**A )** Retrieve the subset of data containing the Right and Left digit in noise (DIN) values. Compute the average DIN by taking the mean of the Right and Left ear readings. Reorganize the dataset, naming it as EHF_Dataset. Calculate the mean and standard deviation of the speech recognition threshold according to age group

```{r, warning=FALSE}

library(dplyr)
library(tidyverse)

#  'EHF_DATASET.csv' contains  dataset of 
f <- "Data/EHF_DATASET.csv" 
d <- read.csv(f, header = TRUE, sep = ",")

# Filter missing values and ages above 15
d <- d %>%
  filter(!is.na(Average_DIN),  # Filter rows where Average_DIN is not missing
         Age_round >= 4,        # Filter rows where Age_round is greater than or equal to 4
         Age_round <= 15)       # Filter rows where Age_round is less than or equal to 15

# Create a new column for age range
d <- d %>%
  mutate(age_range = case_when(
    Age_round %in% c(4, 5) ~ "4-5",
    Age_round %in% c(6, 7, 8) ~ "6-8",
    Age_round %in% c(9, 10, 11, 12) ~ "9-12",
    Age_round %in% c(5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15) ~ "5-15"
  ))

# Calculate mean and SD for each age range
summary_stats <- d %>%
  group_by(age_range) %>%
  summarize(mean_Average_DIN = mean(Average_DIN, na.rm = TRUE),
            sd_Average_DIN = sd(Average_DIN, na.rm = TRUE))


# Create the table like in article
result <- summary_stats %>%
  mutate(Present_study = paste(round(mean_Average_DIN, 2), "(", "\u00B1", round(sd_Average_DIN, 2), ")", sep = "")) %>%
  select(age_range, Present_study)

print(result)
```

-   *Comparison with the original article findings:* In the above code, I attempted to replicate the mean and standard deviation of speech recognition threshold according to age group. The mean and standard deviation reported in the original paper were -4.58 (1.49), -7.11 (2.37), -9.96 (2.80), and -8.29 (3.22) for the age groups 4-5, 6-8, 9-12, and 5-15 years, respectively.

    Based on the output obtained above, although there is slight variation after the decimal value, we were able to replicate the mean and standard deviation for three age groups: 4-5, 6-9, and 9-12 years. However, I found a different mean and standard deviation for the age group 5-15. The original article reported a mean of -8.29 (3.22) for the 5-15 years age range, whereas my calculation showed -9.78 (±2.48).

    *T**here could be several reasons for this discrepancy:***

    1.  The authors might have removed outliers during their calculations.

    2.  The authors could have updated the age range during the publication, and they might not have provided an updated data sheet.

    B\) Calculate Pure tone average of extended high frequencies for EHF Normal and EHF Impaired participants

```{r, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

# Read the data
f <- "Data/threshold.csv"
d <- read_csv(f, col_types = cols(Group = col_character()))

# Calculate average threshold and standard deviation for each group
summary_stats <- d %>%
  group_by(Group) %>%
  summarize(Average_Threshold = mean(PTA_Avg_EHF, na.rm = TRUE),
            SD_Threshold = sd(PTA_Avg_EHF, na.rm = TRUE))

# Print the result
print(summary_stats)

```

-   Comparison with original paper findings: The original paper reported mean PTAEHF values of 5 (SD = 5) and 18 dB HL (SD = 4) for EHF-normal and EHF-impaired children, respectively. Based on the output obtained above, we were able to replicate the PTAEHF values for both the EHF-Normal and EHF-Impaired groups. It's worth noting that in the article, they rounded the values to rounded whole numbers, which matches our replicated findings.

    6.  **REPLICATION OF VISUALIZATION OF DATA**

A\) Create a separate dataset by including DPOAE data from the original dataframe. Read this dataset and generate boxplots for DPOAE Magnitude according to frequencies, distinguishing between two groups: EHF Normal and EHF Impaired.

-   Comparison to the original paper: In this visualization, I am able to replicate almost identical results as presented in the original paper. However, I noticed that the standard error for the EHF-Impaired group was larger than reported in the original paper. One possible reason for this discrepancy could be that the authors had removed outliers during their analysis. Below is the original figure from an article:

    7.  **REPLICATION OF INFERENTIAL STATISTICS**

A\) Conduct a t-test to determine the mean difference in hearing threshold at both standard frequency and Extended High-Frequency (EHF) for both the EHF-Normal and EHF-Impaired groups."

means <- aggregate(PTA_Avg_SF ~ Group, data = d, FUN = mean)

# Extract the mean for the EHF-Impaired group
mean_impaired <- means$`PTA_Avg_SF`[means$Group == "EHF- Impaired"]

# Extract the mean for the EHF-Normal group
mean_normal <- means$`PTA_Avg_SF`[means$Group == "EHF- Normal"]

# Calculate the difference between the means (to show as in article)
mean_difference_sf <- mean_impaired - mean_normal

# Print the difference
print(mean_difference_sf)
#For extended high frequency average , extract the means for each group
means <- aggregate(PTA_Avg_EHF ~ Group, data = d, FUN = mean)

# Extract the mean for the EHF-Impaired group

```

**COMPARISION WITH ORIGINAL PAPER:** The output obtained aligns consistently with the findings reported in the original paper. Specifically, the original article noted that EHF-impaired children exhibited a 3.76 dB higher PTASF and a 13.45 dB higher PTAEHF compared to controls. Additionally, the original article provided 95% confidence intervals for PTASF (2.56 to 4.80) and PTAEHF (11.73 to 15.16), which were mirrored in the output obtained from the code execution. Furthermore, both PTASF (p \< 0.001, partial ω2 = 0.07) and PTAEHF (p \< 0.001, partial ω2 = 0.30) were reported to have statistically significant differences between the EHF-impaired group and the EHF normal group in the original article. Similarly, the output from above code also mirrored these values. Therefore, findings have been successfully replicated.

B\) Read the dataset and modify the data to prepare for running a linear mixed model effect on DPOAE Magnitude among the EHF loss and EHF Normal groups. Apply the linear mixed model effect to assess the difference in DPOAE magnitude while controlling for the effects of age and Otitis Media.

```{r, warning=FALSE}

library(effectsize)
library(broom)
library(lmerTest)
# read the provided dataset
# Read the data
f <- "Data/DPOAE_Update_Long_final_update_gender_one_freq.csv"
d <- read_csv(f, col_types = cols(Group = col_character()))
head(d)
names(d)

#  d is the dataset containg DPOAE data, fitting linear mixed model effect in the dataset controlling the effect of age and otitis media
mixed_model <- lmer(DPOAE_AVG ~ Age_log + EHFLoss + HO_OM + (1|SubjectID), data = d, REML = FALSE)
summary(mixed_model)


# Summary of the mixed model 
summary_model <- summary(mixed_model)
print(summary_model)

# Calculate confidence intervals
  CI <- confint(mixed_model)
  print("Confidence Intervals:")
  print(CI)

# Calculate partial omega squared
partial_omega_squared <- omega_squared(mixed_model)
print(partial_omega_squared)

```

Comparison with the original paper: The results obtained from the execution of the above code were consistent with those reported in the original paper. Specifically,the original article reported the overall DPOAE magnitude was significantly lower for the EHF-impaired group compared to the EHF-normal group (β = -2.47, 95% CI: -4.60 to -0.73, p \< 0.001, partial ω2 = 0.13). The result that are obtained from above code are exactly similar as reported in the original article.Furthermore, the original article reported effects of age and Otitis media history were not significant (age: β = 3.65, 95% CI: -4.83 to 11.93, p = 0.38; OM history: β = -1.83, 95% CI: -6.02 to 2.39, p = 0.38), which aligns with the output obtained above from the above executed code.

8.  **DISCUSSION AND REFLECTION**: In completing the replication assignment, I successfully reproduced much of the content; however, I encountered difficulty in comprehending the statistical analysis employed by the author. A thorough explanation of the statistical methods utilized would have greatly aided in understanding their methodology. Without this information, it was challenging to accurately replicate their approach. After several attempts, I managed to infer their methodology.

    Notably, the author omitted any mention of outlier removal and missing value handling in the method section. This omission complicated the calculation of standard errors and standard deviations. It would have been preferable if the author had provided a detailed description of the statistical methods employed, including any steps taken to address outliers and missing data.
